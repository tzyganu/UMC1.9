New Ultimate Module Creator for Magento 1.7 +
-------------

This is the new version of <a href="https://github.com/tzyganu/moduleCreator">Ultimate Module Creator</a>.


This should be the version 2.0 of the Magento extension but I'm keeping this version for the Module Creator for Magento 2.0.  

Backwards compatibility has been broken.

If someone wants to help with the testing please submit any bugs, improvements or feature requests <a href="https://github.com/tzyganu/UMC1.9/issues">here</a>

Also any good code is welcomed.
